        <article>We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
            And this is our place, we make the rules
            And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
            Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
            Can I go where you go?
            Can we always be this close?
            Forever and ever, ah
            Take me out and take me home
            You're my, my, my, my lover
            We could let our friends crash in the living room
            This is our place, we make the call
            And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
            I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
            Can I go where you go?
            Can we always be this close?
            Forever and ever, ah
            Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
            You're my, my, my, my lover
            Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
            With every guitar string scar on my hand
            I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
            My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
            All's well that ends well to end up with you
            Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
            And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
            And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
            Can I go where you go?
            Can we always be this close?
            Forever and ever, ah
            Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
            You're my, my, my, my
            Oh, you're my, my, my, my
            Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover
            Meet me at midnight
            Staring at the ceiling with you
            Oh, you don't ever say too much
            And you don't really read into
            My melancholia
            I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
            You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
            All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)
            I feel
            The lavender haze creeping up on me
            Surreal
            I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
            No deal
            The 1950s shit they want from me
            I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
            All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
            Is if I'm gonna be your bride
            The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
            Is a one-night or a wife
            I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
            They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
            But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)
            I feel
            The lavender haze creepin' up on me
            Surreal
            I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
            No deal
            The 1950s shit they want from me
            I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
            That lavender haze
            Talk your talk and go viral
            I just need this love spiral
            Get it off your chest
            Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk)
            Talk your talk and go viral
            I just need this love spiral
            Get it off your chest
            Get it off my desk
            I feel (I feel)
            The lavender haze creeping up on me
            Surreal
            I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
            No deal (No deal)

            I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
            Get it off your chest
            Get it off my desk
            That lavender haze
            I just wanna stay
            I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
            You're talking shit for the hell of it
            Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
            You're terrified to look down
            'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
            Of everyone you burned just to get there
            It's coming back around
            And I keep my side of the street clean
            You wouldn't know what I mean
            'Cause karma is my boyfriend
            Karma is a god
            Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
            Karma's a relaxing thought
            Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
            Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
            Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
            Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
            Me and karma vibe like that
            Spiderboy, king of thieves
            Weave your little webs of opacity
            My pennies made your crown
            Trick me once, trick me twice
            Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
            It's coming back around
            And I keep my side of the street clean
            You wouldn't know what I mean
            'Cause karma is my boyfriend
            Karma is a god
            Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
            Karma's a relaxing thought
            Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
            Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
            Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
            Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
            Me and karma vibe like that
            Ask me what I learned from all those years
            Ask me what I earned from all those tears
            Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
            (I'm still here, I'm still here)
            'Cause karma is the thunder
            Rattling your ground
            Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
            Karma's gonna track you down
            Step by step, from town to town
            Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
            Karma takes all my friends to the summit
            Karma is the guy on the screen
            Coming straight home to me
            'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
            Karma is a god
            Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
            Karma's a relaxing thought
            Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
            Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
            Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
            Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
            Me and karma vibe like that
            Karma is my boyfriend
            Karma is a god (Ah)
